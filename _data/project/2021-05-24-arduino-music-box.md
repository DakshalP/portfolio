Creating projects with Arduino is one of my favorite hobbies. I created the original Arduino music box 5 years ago. I have added features to it over the years, including a no-contact trigger for the box through an ultrasonic distance sensor.

Check out the original code for the music box at https://github.com/DakshalP/arduino-song
