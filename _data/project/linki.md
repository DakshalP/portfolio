## Introduction

Linki is a React based web app that uses a local, encrypted IndexedDB to store online meeting links and their passwords. I created it to solve the problem of having too many Zoom links to keep track of after all my classes went online. 

## Built With
* `create-react-app`
* `secure-webstore`, an encrypted version of `idb-keyval` for storing meeting data securely in IndexedDB.
