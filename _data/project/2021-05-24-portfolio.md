## **Introduction**

Creating my portfolio site was a great opportunity to learn a new framework, Gatsby, which enables the creation of static websites using React and GraphQL. I had been interested in learning to use a React-based framework for a while, and an introduction to GraphQL was a nice bonus.

Gatbsy provides an extensive library of [starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters) that provide a framework for your website. I chose [`gatsby-starter-delog`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/W3Layouts/gatsby-starter-delog/) since it was already integrated with the Netlify Content Management System. This let me build out the front end while letting the CMS store and manage my project posts. I also borrowed a header design that I liked from [`gatsby-prismic-starter-prist`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/margueriteroth/gatsby-prismic-starter-prist/).

I wanted the ability to categorize my projects by tags, and so I added this functionality on top of the starter. I learned more along the way, like:

* How Gatsby node converts markdown into posts.
* How to adjust GraphQl queries to access tag data.
* How to configure data input on Netlify CMS.

Next up, I want to learn and use NextJS.
