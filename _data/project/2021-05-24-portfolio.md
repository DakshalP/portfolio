## **Introduction**

Creating my portfolio site was a great opportunity to learn a new framework, Gatsby, which enables the creation of static websites using React and GraphQL. I had been interested in learning to use a React-based framework for a while, and an introduction to GraphQL was a nice bonus.

## **Built With**

-   React
-   Gatsby
-   Netlify CMS
-   GraphQl

## Customization

Gatbsy provides an extensive library of [starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters) that provide a framework for your website. I chose [`gatsby-starter-delog`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/W3Layouts/gatsby-starter-delog/) since it was already integrated with the Netlify Content Management System. This let me build out the front end while letting the CMS store and manage my project posts. I also borrowed a header design that I liked from [`gatsby-prismic-starter-prist`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/margueriteroth/gatsby-prismic-starter-prist/).

Since this starter was very simple, I added functionality that I wanted on top.

Functionality I added includes:

-   A custom card display for posts.
-   The ability to categorize posts by tag.
-   A custom dropdown that filters by tag.
-   A different color theme.
-   A Contact and About section.

Some of the things I learned along the way are:

-   How Gatsby node converts markdown into posts.
-   How to adjust GraphQl queries to access tag data.
-   How to configure data input on Netlify CMS.

Next up, I want to learn and use NextJS.
